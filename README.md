# OIC-130_CellCountScript
This repository is for the analysis request for the Lien Lab to count cells automatically from images collectes off the Incucyte microcope. Images are 8-bit grayscale brightfield, no fluorescence markers were used. 

Primary goal is to have accurate counts as possible; outline accuracy should be prioritized incase morphology metrics are desired later (not indicated at this time).

CellPose will be used for this segmentation task, but additional training is required.
